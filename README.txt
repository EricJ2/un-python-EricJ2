GDP and Internet Usage Analysis Project
Overview:
This project explores two datasets from the United Nations: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and Internet Usage. The objective is to analyze economic development and digital adoption trends across different countries and time periods. Using pandas for data manipulation and seaborn/matplotlib for visualization, this project aims to gain insights into how internet usage correlates with GDP across countries and over time.
Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing global trends in economic growth (as measured by GDP per capita) and internet usage over time. By leveraging data from the United Nations, the goal is to uncover key insights about how these two variables have evolved across different countries and regions. Using pandas for data manipulation and seaborn/matplotlib for visualization, I explored GDP per capita and internet usage trends for the year 2020 and earlier periods, and investigated relationships between these factors.
Conclusion:
Through the analysis, several important trends were identified. Most countries saw an increase in GDP per capita from 1990 to 2020, though some experienced declines. Similarly, internet usage has expanded dramatically, with notable differences in adoption rates across regions. The top three countries with the highest internet usage in 2014 exhibited strong economic performance, further suggesting a link between digital infrastructure and economic prosperity. This analysis provides valuable insights into the economic and digital development landscape, revealing opportunities for further research into how GDP and internet usage are intertwined.
