# UN Data: GDP and Internet Usage Analysis Project

# Intro

This project analyzes global trends in economic growth (as measured by GDP per capita) and internet usage over time. The project sought to uncover key insights about how these two variables have evolved across different countries and regions by leveraging two datasets from the UN: GDP per capita and internet use. Using pandas for data manipulation and seaborn/matplotlib for visualization, I explored GDP per capita and internet usage trends for the year 2020 and earlier periods, investigating relationships between these factors.

# Technologies

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV files (for GDP and internet usage data)

# Features

- Analysis of GDP trends over time, including visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots for selected years (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020).
- Exploration of internet usage trends globally, with a specific focus on 2014, visualizing the percentage of internet users across various countries.
- Merging and correlating GDP per capita data with internet usage percentage to uncover patterns between economic prosperity and internet penetration.
- Advanced visualization using FacetGrid to compare GDP trends for countries with the highest internet usage in 2014.

# Scope

- Investigate and identify trends in GDP and internet usage across different countries and time periods.
- Analyze the relationship between GDP per capita and internet penetration rates, identifying potential outliers or notable countries with high/low GDP or internet usage.
- Provide a foundation for further research on the role of economic factors in driving technological adoption on a global scale.

This project was completed as part of an apprenticeship with Nashville Software School. The task was provided to guide analysis, but the presentation, queries, and approaches are mine and my teammates'. The original README can be found in the questions folder above.
